## Preparing the Dataset
In order to reproduce an analysis the dataset has to be prepared, by decompressing and homogenizing the resolution. This can be done by executing `prepare_dataset.py`. You just have to change the paths and the bottom of the file before. The data set is thereby inflated from around `10GB` to around `400GB`.
